# Posture Check

This program is a must-have for people who have bad posture. Have this run in the background and watch it simultaneously check if you have good or bad posture at the current moment.

## The Algorithm

The code for this program uses the jetson nano. The jetson nano helps by training itself about what good and bad posture is. After it does this, it tells you which one you have using a webcam. The jetson trains itself off of a dataset (pictures taken beforehand) and awards itself when it guesses right and doesn't when it guesses it wrong.  Add images or other descriptions for your project here.
